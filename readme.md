# Claptrap Legacy
This repo contains the source code for the Original Claptrap bot used in my Discord Servers.

The code here is just for learning purposes and while it is fully functional, it has a lot of bugs and bad coding.

To learn more about this, check out this blog post: https://blog.hypherionmc.me/2021/04/21/claptrap-is-now-open-source-well-sort-of/

### Running the bot
Clone or download this repository and open a new Command Prompt/Command line and run:

`gradlew clean shadowJar`

Then head over to the `build/libs` folder and run 

```java -jar Claptrap-0.1-all.jar -token YOURBOTTOKEN```

The code is given here AS IS with no warranty whatsoever and you use it at your own risk
